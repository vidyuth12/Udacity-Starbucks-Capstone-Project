# Motivation for this project:
The motivation for doing this project was primarily an interest in undertaking a challenging project in an interesting area of research.

# Libraries used:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - sklearn (train_test_split, Random forest classifier, logistic regression, SVM, accuracy score)
   

# Project Description:
This is my Udacity Capstone project. For this problem statement, Udacity has partnered with Starbucks. The provided data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free).

# Data set:
The data sets provided were:

   1) Profile: This data set contains information about the customers. It contains details such as their age, gender, income, dare on which they became a member.
    
   2) Portfolio: This data set contains information about the offers given by the company to the customers. It contains details reward, channel of communication, money that has to be spent to receive the reward, duration, offer type.
   
   3) Transcript: This data set contains information about the events of transaction. It contains details such as the person(id that is given in profile data set), event(offer received, offer viewed, transaction, offer completed), time.

The data set was provided by Udacity, which has partnered with Starbucks for this project!
